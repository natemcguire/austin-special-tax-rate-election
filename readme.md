# Austin Tax Rate Election – Public Information Project

## Purpose

This project is a **non-partisan, citizen-focused** effort to give Austin voters clear, factual, and accessible information about the upcoming **Tax Rate Election (TRE)**.  
Our goal is to help residents understand:

- **What a TRE is** and how it affects the City’s budget
- **Historical budget trends** and how spending priorities have shifted over time
- **Potential impacts** on homeowners, renters, and businesses
- **Arguments from multiple perspectives** so voters can make their own informed decision

## Guiding Principles

This project is built on the belief that **an informed public** is essential for good governance.  
Our guiding values are:

1. **Transparency** – Make budget and spending trends understandable to everyone, not just policy insiders.
2. **Clarity** – Present facts and charts in a mobile-friendly format so they are accessible on any device.
3. **Neutrality** – Avoid partisan framing; include both supporter and opponent viewpoints.
4. **Civic Engagement** – Encourage voter participation by explaining when, where, and how to vote.

## Why It Matters

Austin is at a crossroads:

- **Affordability**: Rising property taxes, utility rates, and housing costs are squeezing residents.
- **Public Safety**: Effective allocation of funds is critical for policing, emergency services, and community programs.
- **Quality of Life**: Parks, libraries, infrastructure, and cultural amenities are vital to making Austin **safe, beautiful, and livable**.

By understanding where the money goes and how priorities are set, citizens can help ensure **a safer, more beautiful, and more affordable Austin**.
